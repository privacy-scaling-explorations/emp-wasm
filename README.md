# emp-wasm

Work in progress compiling authenticated garbling from [emp-toolkit/emp-ag2pc](https://github.com/emp-toolkit/emp-ag2pc) to wasm.

Currently this is just a stripped down version that you can compile with a single clang++ command (see `build.sh`).

# Licenses

All MIT licensed but with different authors in different places. See per-directory and per-file licenses. TODO: make this easier.
